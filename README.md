# Purpose

The purpose of this code is to create a simple Kanban board for a user to track their tasks. They can input information about the task along with a date that the task is due. Depending on when the task is due, it will change color to let the user know if they should be aware that something is upcoming, past due, or completed. The user has the option to delete a task at any point and can move the task between the various different lanes to represent the status of its work.
